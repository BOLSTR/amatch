<p>
This is a collection of classes that can be used for Approximate matching,
searching, and comparing of Strings. They implement algorithms that compute the
Levenshtein edit distance, Sellers edit distance, the Hamming distance, the
longest common subsequence length, the longest common
substring length, and the pair distance metric.
